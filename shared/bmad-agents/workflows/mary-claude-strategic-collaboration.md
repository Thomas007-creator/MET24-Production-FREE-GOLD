## **🏗️ CLAUDE'S TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE STRATEGY**

### **System Integration Architecture**

**🎯 Technical Vision**
- **Unified Data Layer**: WatermelonDB as central integration hub
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Cross-feature communication via events
- **Microservice Pattern**: Features as independent but connected services
- **TypeScript Excellence**: Strong typing for integration reliability

**🔧 Core Technical Components**

**1. DataIntegrationHub (Central Orchestrator)**
```typescript
// shared/integration/DataIntegrationHub.ts
class DataIntegrationHub {
  private eventBus: CrossFeatureEventBus;
  private contextAggregator: UserContextAggregator;
  private recommendationEngine: RecommendationEngine;
  private progressTracker: UnifiedProgressTracker;
  
  async integrateFeatures(features: FeatureType[]): Promise<IntegrationResult>;
  async syncUserContext(userId: string): Promise<UserContext>;
  async generateCrossFeatureInsights(userId: string): Promise<Insight[]>;
}
```

**2. CrossFeatureEventBus (Communication Layer)**
```typescript
// shared/integration/CrossFeatureEventBus.ts
class CrossFeatureEventBus {
  async publish(event: CrossFeatureEvent): Promise<void>;
  async subscribe(feature: string, handler: EventHandler): void;
  async getEventHistory(userId: string): Promise<Event[]>;
}
```

**3. UserContextAggregator (Data Unification)**
```typescript
// shared/integration/UserContextAggregator.ts
class UserContextAggregator {
  async aggregateFromCoaching(userId: string): Promise<CoachingContext>;
  async aggregateFromWellness(userId: string): Promise<WellnessContext>;
  async aggregateFromJournaling(userId: string): Promise<JournalingContext>;
  async createUnifiedContext(userId: string): Promise<UnifiedUserContext>;
}
```

### **Performance & Scalability Strategy**

**⚡ Performance Optimization**
- **Lazy Loading**: Load integration data on-demand
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache unified user context
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking integration operations
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient bulk data operations

**📈 Scalability Design**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Independent feature scaling
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient WatermelonDB queries
- **Memory Management**: Optimized context storage
- **Load Distribution**: Balanced integration processing
