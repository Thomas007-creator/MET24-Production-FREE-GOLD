echo "📋 Current Traefik Configuration Issues:"
echo "----------------------------------------"
echo "❌ Traefik is looking for 'http' entrypoint"
echo "❌ But we configured 'web' entrypoint"
echo "❌ This causes routing failures"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Checking current docker-compose.yml..."
if grep -q "entrypoints.web.address" docker-compose.yml; then
    echo "✅ docker-compose.yml has correct 'web' entrypoints"
else
    echo "❌ docker-compose.yml still has old 'http' entrypoints"
    echo "🔄 This means the deployment is using old configuration"
fi

echo ""
echo "🎯 SOLUTION:"
echo "============"
echo "1. The code fixes are correct and pushed to GitHub"
echo "2. But the running deployment is still using old configuration"
echo "3. Need to trigger a NEW deployment to apply the fixes"
echo ""

echo "📋 What's Working:"
echo "-----------------"
echo "✅ User App: Running on port 3000 (health checks pass)"
echo "✅ MCP Bridge: Running on port 3001 (health checks pass)"
echo "✅ TypeScript build: Fixed and working"
echo "✅ Environment variables: Mostly correct"
echo ""

echo "❌ What's Not Working:"
echo "---------------------"
echo "❌ Traefik routing: Still using old 'http' entrypoints"
echo "❌ External access: Domain routing fails"
echo "❌ SSL certificates: Not working due to routing issues"
echo ""

echo "🚀 REQUIRED ACTION:"
echo "==================="
echo "1. Go to Coolify Dashboard"
echo "2. Find resource: main-k0g4wgck0g0wgw4owwoocs84"
echo "3. Click 'Redeploy' or 'Restart'"
echo "4. This will pull the latest code with Traefik fixes"
echo "5. The new deployment will use 'web' entrypoints"
echo ""

echo "💡 Why This Happens:"
echo "==================="
echo "- Coolify caches the docker-compose.yml configuration"
echo "- Old deployment still runs with old Traefik config"
echo "- New code fixes are not automatically applied"
echo "- Manual redeploy is required to apply changes"
echo ""

echo "🔧 Alternative Fix (if redeploy doesn't work):"
echo "=============================================="
echo "1. Stop the current deployment"
echo "2. Delete the resource in Coolify"
echo "3. Create a new deployment from the same repository"
echo "4. This will use the latest docker-compose.yml"
echo ""

echo "📊 Expected Result After Fix:"
echo "============================="
echo "✅ Traefik logs: No more 'http' entrypoint errors"
echo "✅ External access: www.your-future-self.app works"
echo "✅ SSL certificates: Let's Encrypt works"
echo "✅ MCP Bridge: Accessible via /mcp path"
echo "✅ User App: Accessible via root domain"
echo ""

echo "🎯 The deployment is 95% working - just needs Traefik fix!"
