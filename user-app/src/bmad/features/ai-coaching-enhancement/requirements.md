## **🎯 MARY'S IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY**

1. **Complete MBTI Profiles** (Critical - affects 62.5% of users)
2. **Adaptive Session Flow** (High - improves all user experiences)  
3. **Cross-Session Memory** (Medium - enhances long-term value)
4. **Therapeutic Integration** (Low - specialized use case)

**Estimated Development Time**: 6-8 weeks for complete implementation
**Expected User Impact**: 40-60% improvement in coaching effectiveness
**Technical Complexity**: Medium-High (requires ML/AI adaptation algorithms)
